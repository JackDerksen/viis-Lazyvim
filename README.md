# viis-Lazyvim
My perfected Lazyvim configuration

The dependencies should be the same as stock LazyVim.

NOTE: This repo is meant as add-ons to an existing LazyVim install. Just downloading these files and placing them in your .config/nvim directory won't work, as far as I know.

Once you have stock LazyVim installed, place or replace the files in your .config/nvim directory with the files from this repo. Once you start up LazyVim for the first time and it loads everything in, it should all work.
