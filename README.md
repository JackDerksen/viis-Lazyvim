# viis-Lazyvim

This is my perfected Neovim configuration, built on top of [Lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), and designed to pair nicely with my [Tmux setup](https://github.com/JackDerksen/tmux). 

Dependencies should be the same as stock Lazyvim.

### Key plugins include:
 - Harpoon for blazingly fast file switching
 - Oil for file navigation
 - Zen and Twilight for more focused programming
 - Undotree for time traveling
 - Duck.nvim just for fun (I've replaced the duck with a squirrel)

### Plus a whole bunch of awesome keymaps!
 - `shift + k` and `shift + j` while in visual mode to move a block of code up and down (with smart indenting, thanks for this one, Prime)
 - `<leader> + y` to yank to the system clipboard
 - `<leader> + s` for easy search and replace
 - `ctrl + h/j/k/l` for seamless Tmux window navigation
 - `<leader> + e` to toggle a floating Oil window
 - `<leader> + ;` to spawn a squirrel amigo
 - `<leader> + ;;` to kill your new squirrel amigo, you monster!
 - And more!

### I've also disabled some stock Lazyvim plugins that I find annoying:
- nvim-notify
- bufferline.nvim
- neo-tree

### Most background colours have been made transparent so you can use whatever terminal background colour you want for a seamless and sexy af appearance!
